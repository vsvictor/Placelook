/// Collections of fully populated [PortalGroup] objects can be obtained by calling the [Portal.findGroups],
/// [Portal.fetchFeaturedGroups], and [PortalItem.fetchGroups] methods, and from the
/// [PortalUser.groups] property. The load status of such objects is [LoadStatus.loaded].
///
/// Alternatively, a [PortalGroup] object can be constructed using [PortalGroup.PortalGroup(Portal, String)]
/// if the group ID is known. In this case the load status is initially [LoadStatus.notLoaded]
/// and the object needs to be loaded to populate its properties.
///
/// The portal group owner is automatically an administrator and is returned in the list of admins.
/// The access property determines the visibility of the group to other users. If the group is
/// private, no one except the administrators and the members of the group can see it. If the group is
/// shared with an organization, then all members of the organization can see the group.
///
/// Administrators can invite, add to, and remove members from a group, and also update and delete
/// the group. The administrator for an organization may also reassign the group to another
/// member of the organization. Group members may leave the group. Authenticated users may
